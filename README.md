## üéØ How to Use

Using the extension is a completely hands-off process:

1.  **Navigate** to a website that hosts DRM-protected streams (e.g., Your Development Website, etc.).
2.  **Play** any video stream as you normally would.
3.  **Let it Work:** The extension automatically works in the background. You will see a notification badge on the icon (e.g., `‚úì` or `Keys: X`) confirming successful capture.
